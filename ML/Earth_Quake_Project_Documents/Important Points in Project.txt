Model	  Type	          Good For	                      Why It Fails Here
KNN	Supervised	Small, structured datasets	Struggles with spread-out, high-dimensional data
SVR	Supervised	Small, non-linear datasets	Needs tuning, underperforms by default
K-Means	Unsupervised	Clustering, grouping data	Not for prediction tasks
Linear Regression	Supervised	Predicting continuous output	Simple, interpretable, and best fit for this data

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


What does "High-dimensional data" mean?
Imagine you're finding the nearest grocery shop in your area.

You check distance on a map — that’s easy with 2 things: Latitude and Longitude (like X and Y on a map).

But now, let’s say you also include Depth — a third thing, like how deep under the ground the earthquake happened.

More features = more dimensions = harder to measure “closeness”.

🧠 Why distance becomes less meaningful in high dimensions?
In low dimensions (like just Latitude and Longitude), finding nearest neighbors is simple — you just look at the map.

But as you add more features (dimensions), all the points start to look far away from each other, even if they are not.

This makes it harder for KNN to find truly "close" neighbors.


📦 Example:
Let’s say two earthquakes happened:


Latitude	Longitude	Depth
10.0	70.0	5
10.2	70.1	300
On the map, they look very close.

But KNN will say, “Wait! The Depth is so different! So they are far apart.”
➡️ So it gets confused and gives a bad prediction.

Where You Can Use Each Model
1️⃣ KNN Regressor (K-Nearest Neighbors – Regression)
📌 Best Used For:

Small datasets

Clean and well-structured numerical data

Situations where "similar inputs → similar outputs"

🧠 Examples:

Predicting house price based on nearby houses (area, rooms, etc.)

Estimating temperature based on nearby weather stations

Predicting movie ratings based on users with similar taste

🚫 Avoid if:

Data is large, spread out, or has different scales

Real-time speed is needed (KNN is slow at prediction time)

2️⃣ SVR (Support Vector Regression)
📌 Best Used For:

Small to medium datasets

Problems where relationships are not purely linear

Where accuracy matters more than speed

🧠 Examples:

Predicting stock prices (with feature tuning)

Forecasting electricity consumption

Modeling non-linear patterns (with kernel like RBF)

🚫 Avoid if:

Dataset is large (slow training)

You can’t spend time on tuning parameters

3️⃣ K-Means Clustering (Unsupervised)
📌 Best Used For:

Grouping similar data points

Finding patterns or segments in unlabeled data

Preprocessing step before classification

🧠 Examples:

Customer segmentation in marketing (grouping buyers by habits)

Grouping earthquake zones based on Latitude and Depth

Grouping similar images, text documents, etc.

🚫 Avoid if:

You need to predict a target value

Data has complex shapes or overlapping clusters

✅ Quick Comparison Table

Model	Type	Good For	Example Use Case
KNN Regressor	Supervised	Predicting based on closest known data	House price, temperature prediction
SVR	Supervised	Predicting complex non-linear relationships	Stock price, power usage
K-Means	Unsupervised	Grouping/clustering unlabeled data	Customer segmentation, location-based clustering

✅ Mean Squared Error (MSE)
📌 What it is:
MSE tells us how far off our predictions are — on average.

📌 How it works:
It takes the difference between the actual and predicted values, squares them, and finds the average.

📌 In simple words:

“On average, how wrong is our model — and how big are the errors?”

📌 Example:
If MSE = 2.0 → On average, your predictions are about √2 ≈ 1.4 units away from the real value.

📌 Goal:
Lower MSE is better. We want our model’s errors to be small.

✅ R-squared (R²)
📌 What it is:
R² tells us how well our model explains the data.

📌 In simple words:

“How much of the actual result can the model predict correctly using the input features?”

📌 Example:
If R² = 0.80 → Your model explains 80% of the result correctly.
If R² = 0 → Model is no better than guessing the average.
If R² = 1 → Model is perfect.

📌 Goal:
Higher R² is better. We want it close to 1.0.

🎯 Quick Summary:

Metric	Meaning	Simple Explanation	Goal
MSE	Average of squared errors	"How wrong are the predictions?"	Lower = Better
R²	% of variance explained	"How much does the model understand the target?"	Higher = Better
